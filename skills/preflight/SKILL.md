# Preflight Launch Readiness

Use Preflight to scan a project for launch readiness issues before deploy. Treat the CLI output as a triage map for concrete engineering work: configuration gaps, service integration problems, security issues, SEO metadata, web standard files, secrets, and CI readiness.

## Core Workflow

1. Inspect the project before running commands.
   - Locate the project root and check for `preflight.yml`.
   - Skim the stack, deployment shape, env files, public web root, and CI config when relevant.
   - Preserve existing behavior and do not create or edit config until the user has approved changes.

2. Ensure the Preflight CLI is available.
   - Prefer an existing `preflight` binary on `PATH`.
   - Otherwise install it with the repo-documented Homebrew, npm, Go, Docker, or shell installer path.
   - Use `--ci` for agent runs so scans avoid interactive update checks.

3. Initialize config only when needed.
   - If `preflight.yml` is missing, explain that `preflight init` writes project config and may ask about production URLs and services.
   - Ask before running interactive initialization or writing a starter config.
   - Treat `preflight.yml` as potentially sensitive because it can contain staging and production URLs.

4. Run a parseable scan.
   - Prefer JSON for agent analysis:

     ```bash
     preflight scan --ci --format json --verbose
     ```

   - Use human output when the user wants terminal-readable results:

     ```bash
     preflight scan --ci --format human --verbose
     ```

   - Interpret exit codes directly: `0` means all checks passed, `1` means warnings only, and `2` means errors or command/config failure.

5. Triage findings into fixes.
   - Address errors before warnings.
   - For each failed check, inspect the source files or external URL behavior before editing.
   - Fix root causes rather than silencing checks.
   - Use `preflight ignore <id>` only for an intentional false positive or a check the project explicitly does not need.
   - For secrets findings, prefer a path plus `fingerprint: "sha256:<hex>"` allowlist entry over disabling the entire secrets check.

6. Rerun the same scan after changes.
   - Compare the new result against the original findings.
   - Call out any remaining warnings, skipped checks, network-dependent checks, or config assumptions.
   - Do not claim launch readiness when required checks are disabled, unconfigured, or unverifiable.

7. Check previous scans when history would inform the work (optional).
   - If the user asks what changed since last time, whether a finding is new or a regression, or wants to compare against a prior deploy, pull published history from the dashboard instead of guessing.
   - Requires that the user has logged in (`preflight auth login`) and previously published runs (`preflight scan --publish`). If neither is true, say so and continue with the local scan.
   - Prefer JSON for analysis and scope to the current project:

     ```bash
     preflight history --here --format json
     preflight history <run-id> --format json
     ```

   - Use the prior run's check results as the baseline: a check that passed before and fails now is a regression worth surfacing first; a newly passing check confirms a fix landed.

## Common Commands

Use these commands as the default command vocabulary:

```bash
preflight init
preflight scan --ci --format json
preflight scan --ci --format json --verbose
preflight scan --ci --format human --verbose
preflight ignore <check-or-service-id>
preflight unignore <check-or-service-id>
preflight checks
preflight history --here --format json
preflight history <run-id> --format json
```

The `history` commands read previously published runs from the dashboard and
require authentication; treat them as optional context, not part of every scan.

## CI Pattern

Always pin Preflight to a specific release in CI. Floating "latest" lets a future release change scan behavior or, if the supply chain is compromised, run unverified code in the pipeline. The installer verifies the release tarball against `checksums.txt` from the same GitHub release; pinning the version makes that verification meaningful.

Before emitting any of the snippets below, resolve `<release-tag>` to the current latest release tag (for example by reading https://api.github.com/repos/preflightsh/preflight/releases/latest) or by asking the user which version to pin, and substitute it in every occurrence.

Recommend this GitHub Actions pattern when asked to wire Preflight into CI:

```yaml
- name: Run Preflight
  env:
    PREFLIGHT_VERSION: <release-tag>
  run: |
    curl -fsSL https://preflight.sh/install.sh | sh
    preflight scan --ci --format json
```

For container-first projects, recommend a pinned image tag (not `:latest`):

```yaml
- name: Run Preflight
  run: docker run -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/app ghcr.io/preflightsh/preflight:<release-tag> scan --ci --format json
```

When the user prefers a package manager over the shell installer, `brew install preflightsh/preflight/preflight`, `npm install -g @preflightsh/preflight`, or `go install github.com/preflightsh/preflight@<release-tag>` are equally valid and avoid the `curl | sh` pattern entirely.

## Reporting Standard

Finish with a concise report that includes:

- The exact command run and exit code.
- The failing check IDs, grouped by error and warning.
- The files, URLs, or config entries changed.
- The checks rerun and whether they now pass.
- Any residual launch risk or validation that could not be performed.

Keep the report factual. Passing a partial scan is not equivalent to a production-ready launch.
